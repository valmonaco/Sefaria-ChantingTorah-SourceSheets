## Sefaria Chanting Torah Source Sheet Generator

This application takes the input of a range of Torah verses and
provides a generated Sefaria source sheet with scaffolding for
learning how to chant.  The scaffolding includes trope identification
and highlighting, trope cantillation tunes, and full verse chanting audio files.

Audio files were recorded by Cantor Wendy Shermet (Temple Israel, Omaha, NE) and are used with her permission.

The site is a Flask application.  Thanks to Corey Schafer for his helpful
